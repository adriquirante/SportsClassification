To do this, we are going to use neural networks.

This link shows all the experiments made in the experimentations, i.e, how the models performed in traind and evaluations and whic were its metrics.

**Important Comments**
The two .ipynb files are already well commented as a report. All steps have short comments and explanation to cover all our Project and we tried to this this in a clean manner.
The experimentation file is not executed as models lasted long, so we decided to comment them. However, you can see results and logs in the wandb link.
